## Team Stone Wiki 2 - Compilers

1. What is a compiler and what is its purpose? - Yen

A compiler is a program designed to convert a programming language's source code into machine code, bytecode, or another programming language. Typically, the source code is written in a high-level language such as Java or python using a code editor or integrated development environment. Once the programmer has saved the source code to one or more text files, a compatible compiler analyzes and translates it into a format suitable for the target platform[1]. While translating, a compiler also detect and report errors in the source code, helping programmers to correct mistakes before the code is executed.

Compilers that translate source code into machine code are tailored to specific operating systems and computer architectures. This type of output is often called object code. The resulting machine code consists solely of binary digits (1s and 0s), allowing it to be read and executed by the processors on the target machines. For example, a compiler may produce machine code for the Linux x64 or Linux ARM 64-bit platform[1].
